                <h2>i. Do Cats Know Their Name?</h2>
                <p>According to experts, cats can recognize and respond to the names we lovingly gave them—but they don’t always choose to respond. If it seems like your cat readily responds to your voice but ignores your roommate, you might be on to something. 
                    Cats can identify and remember unique vocal patterns, Manucy says. “This means that a cat may respond to a favored family member better than to a less familiar guest,” she explains. According to Manucy, one way to teach a cat or kitten their name is to associate it with positive experiences, 
                    such as by saying their name before giving them a treat, toy, or attention.
                    Clicker-training cats can also be effective, especially in households with multiple cats or kittens. The key is to help your cat understand that their name has significance, and when they hear it, it means we’re seeking their attention.
                </p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">
                    iii. Why does my cat attack me?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Cats are hunters—that’s a fact. Stalking, pouncing, biting, and even bunny kicking are normal ways cats interact with their world, exercising their brains and bodies and releasing pent-up energy. 
                    However, when you become the target of the attack, it’s understandable to feel a mix of surprise, uncertainty, and perhaps frustration as your companion goes from cuddly to aggressive. 
                    Why do cats attack out of nowhere? Boredom and fear are two common culprits, says Joey Lusvardi, certified cat behaviorist and owner of Class Act Cats, a Minneapolis-based cat behavior consulting and training service. 
                    “The best thing you can do is to have regular interactive play sessions with your cat,” he says, adding that discipline tactics, such as spraying your cat with water, only increase unwanted behaviors. Here’s what to do 
                    when your cat attacks you and how to tell the difference between normal play and something more sinister.
                </p>

                <h3><u>
                    Is My Cat Playing or Aggressive?
                </u></h3>    

                <p>
                    Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between cats playing or aggression. While play tends to be fairly quiet, your cat is most likely attacking out of fear or overstimulation if they exhibit any of these behaviors:
                </p>

                <ul style="line-height: 25px;">
                    <li>Aggressive vocalizations, such as hissing, growling, or spitting</li>
                    <li>An arched back, typically with raised hair</li>
                    <li>Ears pinned back</li>
                    <li>Dilated pupils</li>
                    <li>Tense body position with legs or tail tucked</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><u>
                    Is My Cat Attacking Me Because They’re Overstimulated?
                </u></h3>    

                <p>
                    Overstimulation or petting reactivity is common in cats. Like us, cats can experience a sensory overload from too much excitement or stimuli. Cats can become overstimulated on a dime and react aggressively from too much petting, play, or noise. 
                    When cats are reaching their limit, they’ll likely communicate through body language cues such as outward-turned ears, tail flicking, skin rippling, and quick head turns. When overlooked, these subtle signs can quickly turn into an attack.
                    The level of stimulation that triggers overstimulation varies from cat to cat. Adult cats may be more susceptible than kittens, and some cats have lower thresholds regardless of age. Cats with anxiety or those with medical conditions causing tactile sensitivity may be more prone to overstimulation. 
                    To prevent overstimulation, allow your cat to initiate interactions and do your best to learn their body language cues. For instance, pet your cat a few times, then remove your hand and wait for them to indicate they want you to continue. If they walk away or avoid your hand, they’ve had enough pets for now. 
                    Cats also benefit from having a safe, quiet room to retreat to when the household is bustling or noisy.
